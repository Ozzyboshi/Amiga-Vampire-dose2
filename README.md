# dose2
This is an Amiga port of an old demo released on 2001 by Mfx.
This demo does not feature any racism (with italian) according to the author.
Since I am italian I took the liberty of porting the project to Classic Amiga.
This is a quite demanding demo and I tried to target the Vampire platform taking advantage of libSDL+AMMX but should work also on emulated RTG Amigas (Winuae).
