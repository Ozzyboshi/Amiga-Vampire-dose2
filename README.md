# DOSE2 for Amiga Classic (+AMMX for Vampire accellerators)
This is an Amiga port of an old demo released on 2001 by Mfx. 

According to the author this demo does not feature any racism (with italians) and I agree with him. 

Since I am italian I took the liberty of porting the project to Classic Amiga. 

This is a quite demanding demo and I tried to target the Vampire platform taking advantage of libSDL+AMMX but should work also on emulated RTG Amigas (Winuae).
